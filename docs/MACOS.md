# Strata on a Mac (Apple Silicon)

The main document of this independently maintained, Apple Silicon-only fork of
[Strata](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata) (the original's Windows and Linux engines are kept in the repository as
they were at the fork point, but not maintained here; see [docs/README.md](README.md)).

**Tested on one Mac:** a MacBook Pro M5 Max (40-core GPU, 128 GB) on macOS 26.4, with Qwen3.8-Flash-Next Q2_0, IQ3_XXS
and IQ3_S, and GPT-OSS 120B. GLM-5.3-Flash support is in, but not tested end to end yet. Other Apple Silicon Macs and
other model files are untested. Read [Limits and warnings](#limits-and-warnings) before you install.

On a Mac, Strata serves the same web app and APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Responses, MCP) as on a PC. The engine under
them is different: `strata-metal` (`metal/`) runs the model on llama.cpp's Metal backend.

## Before you start

- An Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or newer; setup refuses Intel Macs) with **64 GB of memory or more**. 64 GB is Strata's
  floor for a Mac, not a measured minimum: only 128 GB was tried.
- About **80 GB of free disk** on the internal SSD, and an internet connection for the first run (66 GB download).
- Apple's Command Line Tools (the compiler and git). You do not need the full Xcode app.
- Python 3.10 or newer. If it is missing, setup installs it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) when Homebrew is there;
  otherwise install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Everything else (cmake, ninja, Python
  packages) setup installs into the Strata folder.
- Expect the speed to drop after a few minutes of steady use (on the test Mac the GPU's clock went down; see below).

## Quick start

In Terminal, one line at a time:

```sh
xcode-select --install       # a dialog opens: click Install, wait until it finishes (skip if already installed)

git clone https://github.com/dennis-akimov/Strata.git
cd Strata
make check                   # what this Mac can run; installs nothing
make pull MODEL=Q2_0         # builds the engine and downloads the model; asks about images and the context
make run                     # starts it; open http://127.0.0.1:8080 when it says it is ready
```

`make run` keeps the model running in that Terminal window; Ctrl-C stops it. On the test Mac the engine compiled in
3-6 minutes (once) and later starts took about 35 seconds.

**Getting the model.** `make pull` downloads Q2_0, 66.4 GB in two files, from Hugging Face
([ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF),
pinned to one revision), plus the 0.9 GB image encoder if you answer yes to images. The files go to `Strata-data/`
next to the `Strata` folder; each one's size is checked against the server's when it finishes. If the download stops,
run the same command again: it continues where it stopped. Q2_0, IQ3_XXS (`make pull MODEL=IQ3_XXS`, 75.8 GB) and IQ3_S (`make pull MODEL=IQ3_S`, 83.6 GB) are the sizes tested on a Mac. Add
`SETUP_ARGS="--yes"` to skip the questions, and set `HF_ENDPOINT` to use a Hugging Face mirror.

`make run` alone also works the first time: it asks the same questions, downloads, then starts.

| To | Run |
|---|---|
| run in the background | `make start`, then `make status` / `make stop` (log: `strata-run.log`) |
| send one test message | `make chat PROMPT="Write a haiku"` |
| cap the thinking | `make chat PROMPT="..." EFFORT=high MAX_TOKENS=32768 REASONING_BUDGET=4096` (the thinking is closed there, then it answers if max tokens leaves room); in the web chat: Sampling > Thinking budget |
| use another port | `make run PORT=8090`, or put `PORT := 8090` in a file named `Makefile.local` |
| use a bigger context window | `make run CONTEXT=131072` (up to 262,144; it stays set, and needs more memory) |
| download without questions | `make pull MODEL=Q2_0 SETUP_ARGS="--yes"` |
| try another size (untested on a Mac) | `make pull MODEL=IQ2_XS`, then `make run` |
| turn on the MTP draft layer | `./setup.sh --setup --mtp on` (see below) |
| see every target | `make` |

If setup stops, it says what is missing and the command that fixes it.

## Limits and warnings

- **Memory.** A Mac's CPU and GPU share one memory. Metal sets a limit on how much the GPU may use at once
  (`recommendedMaxWorkingSetSize`); `make check` prints this Mac's value. On the test Mac it was 107.5 of 128 GB; it
  differs between Macs and macOS versions. Q2_0's weights take about 35 GB of it (IQ3_S's about 51 GB), plus the context's cache. Everything
  the Mac does shares the same memory, so close other large apps. Below 128 GB only the 64 GB floor applies: nobody
  has measured how close a 64 GB Mac gets.
- **Of the Qwen sizes, only Q2_0, IQ3_XXS and IQ3_S were tested** (and GPT-OSS 120B of the others). `make check` marks the other sizes "untested on a Mac". On a PC, the Unsloth sizes
  (UD-Q4_K_XL, UD-IQ4_XS) stream part of their experts from the SSD; the Mac engine cannot, so all of a model's experts
  must fit in Metal's limit. UD-Q4_K_XL (111 GB) is larger than the test Mac's default limit.
- **Speed.** On the test Mac: 13-17 tokens/s for the answer and 225-270 tokens/s to read a prompt, with other programs
  running (see [Measured](#measured)). Other Macs will differ; slower memory means fewer tokens per second.
- **It can halve after a few minutes** (in the *Automatic* energy mode; see *Power* above). On the test Mac, short IQ3_S answers with `--mtp on`, sent one after another,
  ran at 59-65 tokens/s in the first minute after a pause and at about 30-35 (at times 13-20) later, with the same
  answers. The slow phase came with a low GPU clock (600-830 MHz), the GPU busy about half the time, 8-11 W and a
  59-69 °C die. The cause was not isolated; macOS's power management is the likely one. A single long answer, Q2_0 and
  MTP off were not measured this way. See [Why the speed changes](#why-the-speed-changes);
  [macmon](https://github.com/vladkens/macmon) (`brew install macmon`, no sudo) shows the GPU's clock live.
- **Power: use *High Power*.** On the test Mac (16-inch, M5 Max) the speed of long answers changed up to 3x with the
  power setup, at only 60-95 °C. Decode tok/s, thinking off, 2026-10-08:

  | | *Automatic*, 96 W adapter | *High Power*, 96 W | *High Power*, 140 W |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|
  | GPT-OSS 120B, 900-word answer | 35 | 46-53\* | 93-100 |
  | GPT-OSS, a short answer right after it | 33 | 49\* | 93 |
  | Q2_0 (MTP on), 900-word answer | 24-27\*\* | 63-69 | 60-67 |
  | GPU clock (during the long answers) | 364-807 MHz | 1,300-1,620 MHz | 1,200-1,620 MHz |

  \* Measured seconds after switching to *High Power*. \*\* From [IQ3_S compared with Q2_0](#iq3_s-compared-with-q2_0)
  (the same MTP settings, but 233-353-token answers).

  The adapter made no difference for Q2_0 (63-69 on the 96 W one, 60-67 on the 140 W one); both were negotiated at the
  same 94 W (20 V, 4.69 A) over the USB-C cable used, so set *System Settings > Battery > Energy Mode* to *High Power*
  where your Mac has it (louder fans; the GPU reached 95 °C) and check the GPU's clock with
  [macmon](https://github.com/vladkens/macmon) when it seems slow. The same slow-down in *Automatic* is in llama.cpp
  [#10444](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/10444) (M3 Max, 96 W adapter). Earlier speed numbers on this page
  were measured in *Automatic*.
- **Disk.** The download is 66.4 GB (67.3 GB with the image encoder); installed with the engine, about 70 GB. `--mtp on`
  adds about 12 GB. Keep the model on the internal SSD: its 28 GB n-gram table is not loaded into memory, its rows are
  read from the model file as they are needed.
- **MTP is opt-in.** It makes answers faster (see Measured), costs about 12 GB of disk and keeps the KV cache 16-bit.
  With it on, a long answer can differ from the answer without it. Two requests at once (`"parallel"`) get no drafts.
- **Not on a Mac yet:** contexts past 262,144 tokens (rope scaling), the PC engine's expert cache and CPU experts.

### If a model does not fit

Pick a smaller size or a smaller context first. If you know what you are doing, you can raise Metal's limit; the
setting lasts until the Mac restarts:

```sh
sysctl -n iogpu.wired_limit_mb               # the current value in MB; 0 means macOS' default
sysctl -n hw.memsize | awk '{print $1/1048576 " MB of memory"}'
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=$(( $(sysctl -n hw.memsize) / 1048576 - 16384 ))   # all memory but 16 GB
sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=0           # back to the default (or to the value the first line printed)
```

macOS' default is already close to this on a 128 GB Mac (107.5 GB there), so this helps most on smaller Macs, which
keep a larger share for the system. Never set more than the Mac's memory.

This is an undocumented macOS setting, and Strata never changes it. Leave macOS plenty of memory (Strata's rule of
thumb: 8-16 GB): set too high, the whole Mac can slow down or stop responding until it restarts.

## What works

| | On a Mac |
|---|---|
| Chat, tools, the web app, the APIs | yes, the same server as on a PC |
| Conversation reuse | yes: a follow-up reads only what is new |
| Pictures | yes: `strata-vision` runs on Metal |
| MTP draft layer | opt-in: `--mtp on` |
| GPT-OSS 120B (OpenAI's harmony format) | yes, set up by hand: see [GPT-OSS 120B](#gpt-oss-120b) |
| EAGLE3 draft model (`--eagle3`) | opt-in engine flag, off: slower than no draft on GPT-OSS ([below](#eagle3-draft-model---eagle3)) |
| Several requests at once (`"parallel"`) | opt-in, the same as on a PC |
| Monitor tab | GPU load, memory and power, the chip's temperature (its die sensors), CPU, RAM; PCIe shows "n/a" (an integrated GPU has no PCIe link) |
| Expert cache, CPU experts, rope scaling, Intel Macs | no |

### The MTP draft layer (`--mtp on`)

The model's own draft head guesses the next 3 tokens, and the model checks them in one pass. Setup builds the head from
the original checkpoint: it downloads the 31 MTP tensors (5 GB, SHA-256 checked) and the embeddings and LM head (2.5 GB),
and llama.cpp's converter makes a 4.1 GB file of them. The converter needs PyTorch, so setup installs it once into
`.venv-mtp` (about 730 MB). llama.cpp pins numpy 2.2.6, which converts this head wrongly (no error, but no draft is ever
accepted), so setup uses numpy 2.4.0 and checks the result against a known SHA-256.

### GPT-OSS 120B

OpenAI's [gpt-oss-120b](https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF) (117B parameters, about 5B active per token,
MXFP4) runs in Strata on the same engine. Setup does not install it; by hand:

```sh
D=../Strata-data/models/gpt-oss-120b; mkdir -p $D
aria2c -x16 -s16 -c -d $D \
  "https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF/resolve/238abdd290bb874b90a5da1b4549881b7d05c091/gpt-oss-120b-MXFP4.gguf" \
  --checksum=sha-256=582bd40f6886200101f4c4ed9f25f3fe80cc14c86e9e2b37746cd8904a0c622d          # 63.4 GB
.venv/bin/python tools/strata_tokenizer.py --gguf $D/gpt-oss-120b-MXFP4.gguf --out ../Strata-data/packs/gpt-oss-120b
```

Then a run config like `strata-<model>.json` with `"args": ["--gguf", "<that file>", "--max-context", "131072", "--kv",
"f16"]`, `"tokenizer": "<the pack>/tokenizer"`, `"backend": "metal"` and OpenAI's suggested sampling `"sampling":
{"temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 1.0}`, and `serve/server.py --engine strata --config <it> --port 8090`.

What Strata does for it: its tokenizer (`pre` = `gpt-4o`, OpenAI's o200k) matched `openai/gpt-oss-120b`'s own
tokenizer on 2,178 strings (87,702 tokens, 0 differences); the server reads its replies in OpenAI's harmony format (the
`analysis` channel is the thinking, `final` the answer, a message `to=functions.NAME` a tool call) and closes the
thinking the harmony way when a thinking budget runs out; the engine keeps its conversation checkpoints at `<|start|>`.

| Measured on the test Mac, 2026-10-08 | |
|---|---|
| Answers, a 40-token thinking budget, a tool call and its result (OpenAI API) | correct |
| Decode, short answers, just after loading | 99-105 tok/s |
| Decode, 256-token answers, minutes later (GPU at ~990 MHz, see [Why the speed changes](#why-the-speed-changes)) | 20-33 tok/s |
| A follow-up that shares the start of the conversation | read only its new part (125 of 167 prompt tokens reused) |
| Memory | the 63 GB file, plus the context's cache |

Limits: GPT-OSS always thinks, so "Off" in the chat's Thinking setting means its low effort. A `tool_choice` that names a
tool is not forced (the model chooses); its template writes one tool call per message. The web chat's own defaults
(temperature 0.6, top-k 20) are Qwen's: set temperature 1.0 and top-p 1.0 there for GPT-OSS. Only the `qwen35` and
`gpt-4o` tokenizers are known to Strata; another model's pack is refused rather than tokenized wrongly.

### EAGLE3 draft model (`--eagle3`)

`strata-metal --eagle3 <gguf> --spec N` drafts with an EAGLE3 model (it reads 3 of the target's layers) instead of an MTP
head; llama.cpp drives both the same way. It is off: on GPT-OSS with
[eagle3-gpt-oss-120b-Q8_0.gguf](https://huggingface.co/ggml-org/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF) (849 MB) it was slower than no draft.
`metal/bench/ab.py`, 4 alternating rounds, 3 prompts, 256 tokens, greedy:

| | No draft | `--eagle3 --spec 3` |
|---|---:|---:|
| Decode, median of the per-run medians | 31.5 tok/s | 23.2 tok/s (0.74x, slower in 10 of 12 runs) |
| Drafts accepted | | 34-52% |

Likely why: this EAGLE3 file keeps the full 201K-token output layer (no reduced draft vocabulary), and checking 4 tokens of
a mixture-of-experts model reads up to 4 tokens' worth of experts. On the 3,676-token prompt the greedy answer also differed
from the one without a draft (the 4-token check rounds differently). With EAGLE3 the engine rolls back one cell more than a
checkpoint holds: llama.cpp keeps EAGLE3's one-cell lag in a checkpoint only for a recurrent model, and without it the
draft would skip a position (`metal/strata_metal.cpp`, `rollback`).

## Measured

On the test Mac: Q2_0, 32K context, through the server's OpenAI API, greedy, thinking off, a fresh prompt each run,
medians of 3, 2026-10-06, with other programs running (the answer speed moved by ±3 tokens/s between runs).

| Prompt | Reads the prompt | Writes the answer | With `--mtp on` |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 25 tokens (a story) | - | 16.2 tok/s | 17.2 tok/s |
| 3,686 tokens (code) | 241 tok/s | 12.8 tok/s | **21.6 tok/s** |
| 26,051 tokens (code) | 225 tok/s | 17.0 tok/s | 19.4 tok/s |

- The `--mtp on` column was measured on a later engine build (it also reads prompts faster: 272 and 252 tok/s), so
  its ratios to the other column mix two changes. MTP alone, on the same build: 1.23-1.50x on 3 short chat prompts,
  with 64-92% of drafts accepted; prose gained least.
- After the 26K prompt, a follow-up message started answering in 0.3 s (0.7 s with MTP).
- One picture (640×240, a 196-token prompt) was read and answered in 3.4 s in all.
- Two requests at once with MTP: 17.2 tok/s together against 18.7 one after the other (batch slots decode without
  drafts). llama.cpp's `batched-bench` without MTP: 13.2 tok/s for one sequence, 22.5 for two, 29.7 for four.
- No large overhead over llama.cpp was apparent: `llama-bench` on the same file gave 16.9 tok/s output.

### IQ3_S compared with Q2_0

IQ3_S (3.5 bits) has 46% more expert weights than Q2_0 (54.8 GB against 37.6 GB in the first file; the 28.8 GB
n-gram file is the same), so it was expected to write about 30% slower. Measured on the test Mac, 2026-10-08: the same
settings for both (128K context, f16 cache, `--mtp on`, 2 batch slots), greedy, thinking off, through the OpenAI API,
the two models loaded in turns (IQ3_S, Q2_0, IQ3_S, Q2_0), medians of 4 runs, with a Rust build, a virtual machine
and Docker running (load average 10-40).

| | Q2_0 | IQ3_S | IQ3_S / Q2_0 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Writes the answer, short prompt (33 tokens) | 27.3 tok/s (25.7-29.7) | 24.3 tok/s (21.1-27.0) | 0.89 |
| Writes the answer, 3,775-token prompt | 24.4 tok/s (18.6-27.2) | 22.6 tok/s (22.3-24.0) | 0.93 |
| Reads the 3,775-token prompt | ~367 tok/s | ~346 tok/s | 0.94 |
| MTP drafts accepted | 60-64% | 53-58% | |
| Engine memory at a 128K context | | ~74 GB | |

- IQ3_S was only 7-11% slower in these runs despite 46% more expert bytes, so reading the expert weights is not most
  of a token's time; these runs do not show which costs are. Its drafts were accepted a little less often, a possible
  part of the gap.
- Q2_0's 18.6 tok/s run came when the load average reached 40; without it, the long-prompt range is 24.3-27.2.
- So on this Mac IQ3_S costs about a tenth of the speed and 16 GB more memory; its quality was not measured here
  (the model card rates it closest to the full model).

### IQ3_XXS compared with Q2_0

IQ3_XXS (3-bit) has a 47.0 GB first file against Q2_0's 37.6 GB (the n-gram file is the same: setup can share it).
Measured on the test Mac, 2026-10-08, *High Power*, the same settings for both (128K context, f16 cache, `--mtp on`, 2
batch slots), thinking off, through the OpenAI API, each model loaded on its own, an hour apart:

| | Q2_0 | IQ3_XXS |
|---|---:|---:|
| Writes the answer, 900-word answers | 63-69 tok/s | 46-48 tok/s |
| Writes the answer, short answers | 97-102 tok/s | 73-92 tok/s |
| MTP drafts accepted | 49-50% | 49% |
| GPU clock during the long answers | 1,300-1,620 MHz | 930-1,120 MHz |
| Engine memory | | 65.2 GB |

- IQ3_XXS was about 30% slower here, but the GPU ran at a lower clock during its run, so part of that gap is the Mac's
  state rather than the model: the interleaved IQ3_S/Q2_0 comparison above, with 46% more expert bytes, found 7-11%.
  Read it as 10-30% slower, for better quality than Q2_0 (not measured here).

### Why the speed changes

Measured on the test Mac, 2026-10-08, IQ3_S with `--mtp on` and `--spec 3`, the engine driven directly, one 256-token
answer to the same prompt again and again:

- In the first minute after a pause: 59-65 tok/s, about 44 ms per verify step. After a few minutes: 30-36 tok/s, about
  82 ms per step. The accepted drafts were the same total every time (165 of 273).
- [macmon](https://github.com/vladkens/macmon) in the slow phase: GPU 600-830 MHz, 40-50% busy, 8-11 W, die
  59-69 °C. A fast phase was not recorded with macmon. In both phases the engine's main thread spent most of its time
  (88% fast, 91% slow) waiting for the GPU to finish.
- Tried without a measurable change in the slow phase: fewer CPU threads and no spin-waiting (`--threads 1/4`,
  `--poll 0`), reading the n-gram file into the cache first, stopping a Time Machine backup and a busy System Settings
  storage scan. `GGML_METAL_NO_RESIDENCY=1` was tried only in a fast phase (56-66 against 59-65 tok/s).
- `--spec 3` stayed the default: `--spec 2` was about the same or slower, `--spec 4` slower.
- Where a verify step's time goes (`STRATA_PHASES=1` prints it per request to the engine's log; it adds two
  synchronizations, so use it to compare phases, not for speed): in a fast phase, about 51 ms a step = 41 ms for the
  target model to check 4 tokens, 7-8 ms for the 3 draft steps (each waits for the GPU), 2 ms for the MTP catch-up,
  under 1 ms sampling. So the draft round trips are at most about 15% of a step: removing them all would gain less than
  that, and most of their time is the draft head's own work (it has the full 248K-token output layer).
- Stopping the drafts early when the draft head is unsure (`p_min` 0.5) was 5% slower and changed the answer's tokens.
- `llama-bench` on the same file: a forward pass of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8 tokens took about 21, 28, 34, 31 and 42 ms in
  one run, so checking 4 drafted tokens costs about 1.5x one token; in another run, minutes later, a 4-token pass took
  38 and then 169 ms. The engine's 41 ms for its 4-token check and `llama-bench`'s 31 ms came from different runs, so
  they do not show an overhead in the engine.
- What the engine's check needs beyond `llama-bench`'s pass, timed in one process against the same model: logits for
  all 4 tokens about +1-4%, the hidden rows the draft head reads about +0-3%, the recurrent-state snapshots that let
  rejected drafts be taken back about +6-9%. All three are needed for MTP. (The draft head's context builds a
  throwaway CPU thread pool for each call; in a profile that was 0.04% of the time.)
- The llama.cpp update of 2026-10-08 (55 upstream commits, among them few-row matrix kernels and a Metal fusion fix)
  was faster in two A/Bs: +11.5% (4 rounds, p = 0.46) and +8.3% (6 rounds, p = 0.054; 15 of 18 runs faster), with
  the same tokens every run. Which upstream change gives it was not isolated.
- Strata's two kernel patches (below) are now off by default: on the new commit, the build without them was 5.7%
  faster in one A/B (6 of 6 runs, the same tokens); a second A/B was swamped by a clock drop and showed nothing either
  way. They had not been measurably faster on the earlier commit either.
- Both changes together against the engine as it was that morning (6 alternating rounds, 3 prompts): the new one was
  faster in 12 of 18 runs, by 6% on average (paired geometric mean; +11.5% by medians), with the same tokens. During
  the run both fell from about 38 to about 17 tok/s as the GPU's clock dropped, so the gain is small next to the
  swings.

### Compared with MLX (mlx-lm)

Would Apple's MLX run this model faster? Measured on the test Mac, 2026-10-07. The same Q2_0 weights were converted to
MLX: the 2-bit experts copied bit for bit, the other tensors requantized one bit higher, the 28 GB n-gram table at 5
bits. They ran in mlx-lm on MLX 0.32.3 with the community port of this model
([mlx-lm#1788](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-lm/pull/1788), not merged as of that date). Each server ran alone, in
turn, on the same prompts: greedy, thinking off, MTP off, through its OpenAI API.

| | Strata (llama.cpp Metal) | mlx-lm (MLX) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Writes the answer, best run | 48.3 tok/s | 41.5 tok/s |
| Writes the answer, worst run (a virtual machine running) | 24.7 tok/s | 17.1 tok/s |
| Reads a 3,290-token prompt | 364-895 tok/s | 286-493 tok/s |
| Memory in use | ~35 GB of weights; the n-gram table stays in the file | ~81 GB, all of it in memory |
| Start | ~35 s | ~160 s |

- The load from other programs was not controlled and moved both engines by up to 2x (an Xcode build pulled MLX
  down to 15-19 tok/s while a GPU benchmark kept its full speed), so read the table as ranges, not as a ranking.
- The answers are not the same: 3 of 12 greedy answers matched; the rest parted after 2 to 58 tokens (the non-expert
  weights are requantized for MLX, and the two backends round differently; which matters more was not isolated).
- mlx-lm's server slowed down on repeated requests (40.7 to about 20 tok/s) until its prompt cache was turned off
  (`--prompt-cache-size 0`).
- Tried on the MLX side: the n-gram lookup on the GPU from one table, and fused hyper-connection steps (same tokens,
  no change beyond the noise); 8-bit hyper-connection weights were slower (26.3 against 32.7 tok/s) and changed the
  answer.
- So MLX was not faster here and needs more than twice the memory: Strata stays on llama.cpp, and the MLX conversion
  is not part of Strata.

## How it fits together

- `metal/strata_metal.cpp`: the engine. It speaks the CUDA engine's line protocol (`GEN`/`GENI`, `T`, `PP`, `RESUME`,
  `DONE`, `STOP`, `SAVE`/`RESTORE`, and `BGEN`/`BT`/`BDONE`/`BADM`/`BSTOP` for batch slots), so every server feature
  works through it. It adapts the protocol instead of porting the CUDA engine, whose kernels and expert cache are CUDA
  code; llama.cpp already runs this model on Metal.
  - Conversation reuse goes back to a checkpoint of the recurrent state, taken before each `<|im_start|>`. It never
    uses a state that does not match: tokens are compared by id, and picture cells by the picture's hash.
  - Pictures get the CUDA engine's M-RoPE positions.
- `metal/setup_mac.py`: setup's Mac steps. `setup.py` runs it by itself on macOS; it changes none of setup's other steps.
- `metal/mtp_gguf.py`: the MTP head for llama.cpp, from the checkpoint, checked by its SHA-256.
- `serve/telemetry.py`: the Monitor's GPU load comes from `ioreg`, its memory limit from Metal, its power from
  IOReport's energy counters and the temperature from the chip's die sensors, all without root. These are private
  macOS interfaces: if a macOS update changes them, the tiles show "–" instead of a wrong number.

## For developers

```sh
make build                                   # build-metal/: the engine and strata-vision
make test                                    # the tests that need no GPU and no model
make test-engine TEST_GGUF=<a small .gguf with <|im_start|>, e.g. LiquidAI LFM2-350M Q8_0>
```

llama.cpp comes at a pinned commit (`-DSTRATA_LLAMA_DIR=<checkout>` builds offline). Strata's own Metal kernels are
patches on that commit in `metal/patches/`, off by default; `-DSTRATA_METAL_KERNEL_PATCHES=ON` applies them. To A/B
the two:

```sh
make build-ab                                # build-metal-a (plain) and build-metal-b (patched)
make ab AB_GGUF=<shard 1> AB_PROMPTS=<json list of token-id lists>
```

`metal/bench/ab.py` runs both builds in turns and exits 1 when their greedy tokens differ. Results on the earlier pin
(2026-10-06), on Q2_0 on the test Mac:

- `0001-metal-fuse-scale-unary`: fuses a scale into the following unary op; the same tokens on the tested prompts, no
  measurable speedup.
- `0002-metal-short-row-mat-vec`: a mat-vec kernel for short rows; 1.8x faster on its own (15.2 vs 27.3 µs), +1.1%
  for the whole model, within the run-to-run noise. `GGML_METAL_MV_SHORT_DISABLE=1` turns it off.

`metal/test_strata_metal.py` speaks the protocol to the binary: a diverging conversation must give a fresh engine's
tokens, an extended prompt must read only its new part, a different picture with the same ids must not be reused, two
batch slots must each give what they give alone, and STOP, BSTOP, SAVE/RESTORE and every refusal must keep both sides
in step. Four of these checks were mutation-tested.
